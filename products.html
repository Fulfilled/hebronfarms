        <p>We have rice farms in three states: Akwa Ibom, Benue and Nassarawa with a combined capacity to produce over 15000 tons of rice per year. We work with both foreign and local experts to evolve local rice into rice with superior quality, well-packaged and affordable with excellent nutritional standards.
          <p>
            Our state-of-the-art rice processing plants ensures nothing but quality – because at Hebron, quality is our watchword!

            <p>
              We don’t just stop at production and processing; our marketing strategy covers depots that are closer to the wholesaler, retailer and the consumer, with future plan of interstate delivery. Our products are transported directly from our farms to the warehouses and then to the points of supplies, thereby leaving no room for quality compromise.
            </p>
            
            We also buy rice from selected local rice farmers through the out-grower scheme to supplement our production because we believe in supporting the local rice farmers and growing the local rice industry. We are working to ensure that Hebron rice becomes a household name in the supply of this staple food.</p>
